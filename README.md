# DiscordGaleryPlugin
A lot of channels are essentially imageboards, where discussion is minimal and images are posted almost exclusively. With this plugin, use the left and right or up and down arrow keys when zoomed in on an image to quickly load the next one similar to how a folder full of images works on a home computer. 

It Will load every image visible in the current active channel. If you scroll up to the past it will load older images.   

# F12 - (When zoomed in on an Image) Start Plugin.
# F11 - (When the plugin is running) Download Current Image.
# Down/Up Arrow - Next/Previous Image.
# Right/Left Arrow - Next/Previous Image.
